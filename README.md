# -Siamese-Neural-Networks-for-One-shot-Image-Recognition
Assignment purpose: Use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to carry out the task of facial recognition. We implemented a one-shot classification solution using Siamese Neural Networks based on the paper “Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition” (Koch et al. 2015).
